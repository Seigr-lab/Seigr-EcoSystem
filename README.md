# Seigr

Seigr is a modular, eco-inspired network and data management ecosystem crafted for resilience, adaptability, and transparency. Emulating the distributed intelligence of mycelium networks, Seigrâ€™s infrastructure self-organizes, self-heals, and prioritizes sustainability across its core functionalities. Its decentralized, ethically-driven framework is designed for managing data, file distribution, and network connectivity with adaptive resilience.

## Overview

Seigr is a dynamic, modular ecosystem integrating biomimetic principles with decentralized protocols. Files, nodes (or "hyphens"), and data segments work cohesively to optimize network resilience, self-repair capabilities, and adaptability to real-time insights. Key areas of focus include data lineage tracking, self-healing replication, secure identity, data integrity checks, real-time analytics, and AI-enhanced adaptability.

This document provides an overview of the current development progress, completed milestones, and the roadmap ahead.

Notable recent developments have introduced new protocols, adaptive streaming, real-time monitoring, and advanced analytics, enhancing Seigr's robustness and modularity.

### 1. **Expanded Protocol Buffers**
   - **New Protocol Buffers**: Added `visualization.proto`, `streaming.proto`, `machine_learning.proto`, `network.proto`, `alerting.proto`, `sensor_management.proto`, and more to enable advanced visualization, real-time data ingestion, machine learning model handling, and adaptive alerts.
   - **Enhanced Analytics**: Expanded `analytics.proto` with support for trend analysis, proactive alerts, and adaptive thresholds.

### 2. **Real-Time and Adaptive Network Support**
   - **Network Management**: `network.proto` enables custom protocols for peer-to-peer interactions, with scalability for cross-protocol interoperability.
   - **Sensor and Streaming Support**: `sensor_management.proto` and `streaming.proto` now support continuous data ingestion and adaptive data streaming from network sensors.

### 3. **Machine Learning for Adaptive Resilience**
   - **ML Protocols**: `machine_learning.proto` includes model versioning, training, and inferencing, laying the groundwork for AI-driven decision-making.
   - **Predictive Analytics**: Added metrics for anomaly detection, resilience prediction, and historical trend analysis.

### 4. **Advanced Alerting and Monitoring**
   - **Configurable Alerting**: `alerting.proto` enables multi-level alerts, severity-based responses, and configurable notification channels.
   - **Adaptive Alert Thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds for alerts adjust to contextual changes across the network and data storage layers.
