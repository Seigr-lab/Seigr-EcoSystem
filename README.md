# Seigr

Seigr is a modular, eco-inspired network and data management ecosystem designed for resilience, adaptability, and transparency. Drawing inspiration from natural systems such as mycelium, Seigr infrastructure self-organizes, self-heals, and prioritizes sustainability. Its core components establish a secure, resilient, and ethically-driven foundation for managing data, distributed files, and network connectivity.

## Overview

Seigrâ€™s mycelium-inspired digital ecosystem integrates modular components to support dynamic, eco-conscious data and network interactions. Files, nodes (hyphens), and network layers collaborate dynamically to enhance network resilience and user-centric functionality. Key elements include lineage tracking, replication and recovery management, identity services, data integrity, real-time analytics, and AI-powered adaptability.

This README provides an overview of recent work, milestones, and a roadmap for future development.

## Features & Modules

Seigrâ€™s architecture includes the following primary modules:

- **Crypto Layer**: Eco-efficient hashing and encoding protocols for secure data management.
- **Lineage Management**: Modular components for tracking file history and lineage integrity.
- **Replication**: Mechanisms for redundancy, resilience, and self-healing capabilities.
- **File Management**: Adaptive, context-aware file structures that support efficient replication and validation.
- **Identity**: Decentralized identity management for secure user and node validation.
- **IPFS Integration**: Leveraging IPFS for distributed, decentralized file storage.
- **Analytics & AI**: Real-time data analysis, AI-driven adaptability, and user-centric insights.

## Recent Work and Updates

Significant progress has been made on various components, introducing new protocols, streaming support, machine learning capabilities, network management, and advanced analytics. These updates enhance Seigrâ€™s adaptability, security, and modularity. Key updates include:

### 1. **Protocol Buffers Expansion**
   - **New Protocol Buffers**: Added `visualization.proto`, `streaming.proto`, `machine_learning.proto`, `network.proto`, `alerting.proto`, `sensor_management.proto`, and others to support visualization, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and robust alerting mechanisms.
   - **Enhanced Analytics**: Expanded `analytics.proto` with threshold-based monitoring, trend analysis, and alert levels.

### 2. **Real-Time and Adaptive Network Integration**
   - **Network Management**: Introduced `network.proto` to enable Seigrâ€™s custom protocols, with future scalability for direct protocol handling and peer-to-peer networking.
   - **Sensor and Streaming Support**: Developed `sensor_management.proto` and `streaming.proto` to support real-time data ingestion, adaptive streaming, and sensor-based data collection.

### 3. **Machine Learning and Data-Driven Insights**
   - **ML Protocols**: `machine_learning.proto` supports training, inference, and versioned model management, paving the way for AI-driven decision-making within Seigr.
   - **Predictive Analytics**: Enhanced `analytics.proto` with forecast metrics, anomaly detection, and historical analysis capabilities.

### 4. **Alerting and Threshold-Based Notifications**
   - **Alerting Framework**: `alerting.proto` enables threshold-based alerts, severity levels, and notifications via multiple channels for proactive monitoring.
   - **Adaptive Alert Levels**: Configurable alerting thresholds provide responsive and contextual alerts across network and data components.
