## Overview

The Seigr ecosystem is built to reimagine decentralized computation through an eco-conscious and biomimetic approach. Integrating senary encoding, AI-driven adaptability, and distributed storage protocols, Seigr's architecture fosters a self-healing, highly scalable, and transparent network. Nodes (referred to as "hyphens") dynamically respond to data needs and anomalies, reinforcing the ecosystemâ€™s resilience and optimizing its efficiency. Key areas include data lineage tracking, adaptive replication, secure identity services, real-time analytics, and AI-enhanced self-healing.

This document provides a detailed overview of Seigr's core functionality, the latest updates, the roadmap, and development goals that make Seigr a unique and future-focused ecosystem.
