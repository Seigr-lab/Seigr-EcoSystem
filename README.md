# Seigr

Seigr is a modular, eco-inspired file and network ecosystem designed for resilience, adaptability, and transparency. Inspired by natural networks such as mycelium, Seigrâ€™s infrastructure is intended to self-organize, self-heal, and prioritize sustainability. Its core components are designed to establish a secure, resilient, and ethically-driven data and network management system.

---

## Overview

Seigr offers a unique, mycelium-inspired digital ecosystem where files, nodes, and network layers work in harmony. The aim is to create a modular system where each component adapts dynamically to network conditions and user needs, contributing to the resilience and sustainability of the network as a whole. The platformâ€™s modular architecture includes several core components: lineage tracking, replication management, identity services, and integrity protocols.

This README provides a summary of recent work, completed milestones, and a roadmap of planned development.

## Features & Modules

Seigrâ€™s structure consists of the following primary modules:

- **Crypto Layer**: Efficient, eco-friendly hashing and encoding protocols.
- **Lineage**: Modular components for tracking file history and lineage integrity.
- **Replication**: Mechanisms to ensure file redundancy, resilience, and self-healing capabilities.
- **File Management**: Adaptive, self-describing file structure that supports efficient replication and validation.
- **Identity**: Decentralized identity management for secure user and node validation.
- **IPFS Integration**: Leveraging IPFS for distributed file storage.

## Recent Work and Updates

Significant progress has been made on various components, with notable advancements in the modularization of the `Lineage` subsystem, allowing for highly customizable lineage tracking and integrity verification. This restructuring has set the foundation for future modules, such as `Replication` and `Self-Heal`, to adopt a similar modular approach. Below is a summary of the key updates:

### 1. **Lineage Modularization**
   - The lineage system is now split into distinct files (`lineage`, `lineage_entry`, `lineage_integrity`, `lineage_serializer`, and `lineage_storage`) for isolated testing and modular development.
   - Created `LineageEntry` to manage individual lineage records and implemented a serialization process to enable seamless storage and recovery.

### 2. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Expanded the test suite to cover `Lineage`, `LineageEntry`, and `LineageIntegrity` components.
   - Developed and refined tests for each sub-module in the lineage component.
   - Initiated foundational tests for `Replication` with a modular structure, enabling isolated tests for each part.

### 3. **Sponsorship and Contributor Documentation**
   - Updated `README.md` to provide an overview of current progress and future plans.
   - Improved documentation to outline how sponsors and contributors can support and benefit from the project.
