# Seigr Protocol Documentation

## Overview

The **Seigr Protocol** is a decentralized and modular protocol architecture designed to support the Seigr ecosystem. The protocol files provide structured communication, data management, and governance functionalities inspired by biomimetic principles, focusing on adaptability, resilience, and scalability.

This document outlines each `.proto` file, detailing its purpose, components, and usage. It also describes the protocol’s structure, extension patterns, and guidelines for contributing enhancements.

### Core Protocols

#### 1. `access_control.proto`

- **Purpose**: Manages permissions, roles, and resource access across Seigr components.
- **Components**:
  - **Roles**: Defines system roles and associated permissions.
  - **Permissions**: Configures access levels and actions for specific resources.
- **Usage**: Used by components requiring user role and access verification.

#### 2. `alerting.proto`

- **Purpose**: Sets up rules, notifications, and escalation paths for alerting across Seigr.
- **Components**:
  - **Alert Rules**: Defines conditions and thresholds for generating alerts.
  - **Escalation Paths**: Manages escalation levels for severe alerts.
- **Usage**: Ideal for monitoring systems, anomaly detection, and alert distribution.

#### 3. `analytics.proto`

- **Purpose**: Supports data aggregation, reporting, and dashboard analytics.
- **Components**:
  - **Metrics**: Defines metrics for performance and usage tracking.
  - **Dashboard Config**: Structures analytics dashboard settings and visual elements.
- **Usage**: Used by components collecting and displaying operational metrics.

### Specialized Extensions

#### 4. `event.proto`

- **Purpose**: Enables event-driven interactions and routing within Seigr.
- **Components**:
  - **Event Types**: Enum for classifying events such as ERROR, ALERT, and USER_ACTION.
  - **Event Subscriber**: Defines subscriber details for receiving events.
- **Usage**: Supports asynchronous communication and real-time notifications.

#### 5. `cross_chain_operations.proto`

- **Purpose**: Provides a protocol for cross-chain data exchange and operations.
- **Components**:
  - **Transaction Types**: Enum defining types of transactions (e.g., TRANSFER, SWAP).
  - **Cross-Chain Log**: Tracks cross-network operations and transaction history.
- **Usage**: Used in decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations and blockchain interoperability.

### Modular Functionalities

#### 6. `sensor_management.proto`

- **Purpose**: Manages sensor registration, data logging, alerting, and predictive maintenance.
- **Components**:
  - **Sensor Network Config**: Configures settings for clusters of sensors and alert management.
  - **Predictive Maintenance**: Uses historic data to predict and prevent sensor failures.
- **Usage**: Essential for IoT setups, environmental monitoring, and predictive alerts.

#### 7. `resource_management.proto`

- **Purpose**: Monitors and allocates resources across the Seigr network.
- **Components**:
  - **Resource Demand Forecast**: Predictive model for proactive scaling.
  - **Resource Distribution**: Manages load balancing across clusters with efficiency settings.
- **Usage**: Used in resource allocation, auto-scaling, and demand-based resource distribution.

### Contributing to Seigr Protocol

The Seigr Protocol is an open-source project, welcoming contributions that align with its principles of modularity, resilience, and decentralization. Contributors are encouraged to enhance existing `.proto` files or introduce new ones as per Seigr's evolving requirements.

#### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Modular Design**: Maintain a modular structure to ensure components can operate independently.
2. **Documentation**: Each `.proto` file should have detailed documentation explaining each message and enum.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive and consistent naming. Avoid abbreviations or ambiguous terms.
4. **Testing**: Provide test cases and examples for any new protocol extensions.

#### Adding New `.proto` Files

When adding new `.proto` files:
- Place the file in the appropriate directory (e.g., core, extensions).
- Update this documentation with a brief summary of the file’s purpose and components.
- Ensure compatibility with existing protocols and validate against Seigr’s integration tests.

---

### Best Practices and Style Guide

- **Consistent Naming**: Use `CamelCase` for enums and `snake_case` for fields.
- **Version Control**: Follow semantic versioning for `.proto` files.
- **Inter-Protocol Dependencies**: Avoid deep dependencies between `.proto` files to ensure modularity.
- **Security**: Implement field-level encryption where necessary, especially in access and identity management protocols.
- **Documentation**: Each field, message, and enum should have comments explaining its purpose.

### API and Service Integration

Seigr Protocol is built to support seamless integration with decentralized networks, blockchain platforms, and distributed data systems. Below are general guidelines for API and service integration.

1. **gRPC Compilation**: Compile `.proto` files to generate client and server libraries for gRPC.
2. **REST API Compatibility**: Use OpenAPI specifications to ensure REST-compatible API endpoints where needed.
3. **Service Interoperability**: Ensure services interacting with Seigr Protocol maintain compatibility with protobuf schema updates.
