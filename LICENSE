# Provisional Rebel Earthling License (RE License)

**Version 0.1**  
*This is a provisional license text for the Rebel Earthling License (RE License), provided as an initial framework until the full RE License implementation is integrated into the Seigr Ecosystem.*

## Preamble

The Rebel Earthling License (RE License) is designed to support ethical, decentralized, and community-centered collaboration within the Seigr Ecosystem. This provisional license text establishes guidelines for contributions, metadata management, and community-based ethics within this repository, in preparation for the full implementation of the RE License.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This license aims to:
1. Encourage and protect sustainable, collaborative creation within the Seigr Ecosystem.
2. Facilitate the transparent tracking, verification, and ethical management of contributions, ensuring community alignment and rewarding quality participation.
3. Serve as a transitional license that may evolve, with future versions governed by the Seigr community’s input and values.

## 2. Attribution and Contribution Management

1. **Attribution**: All contributions must be attributed to their original creators, with metadata identifying the contributor’s alias, digital wallet, and blockchain verification information.
2. **Modular Contributions**: Contributions are modular and may be adapted by other contributors within the ecosystem, provided that proper attribution is maintained and metadata is updated to reflect new contributions.
3. **Metadata Embedding**: Each file may include metadata embedded as a unique identifier, which may be further developed to align with Seigr’s IPFS-based storage and decentralized verification processes.

## 3. Ethical Collaboration and Community Review

1. **Community-Aligned Standards**: Contributors must adhere to ethical standards that promote transparency, sustainability, and respect for collaborative work.
2. **Community Review**: Contributions may be flagged for ethical review by Seigr community members. Such reviews help maintain alignment with shared values and uphold the quality of contributions within the ecosystem.
3. **Community Governance**: Contributors and community members may participate in future governance decisions regarding modifications or extensions to this license, as the full RE License is implemented.

## 4. Decentralized Storage and Metadata Verification (Planned)

1. **IPFS Integration**: The RE License will integrate IPFS-based metadata and storage to support decentralized, tamper-resistant records of contribution.
2. **License Verification**: Metadata embedded in files will support universal verification of the license’s authenticity and the creator’s digital signature, maintaining integrity across distributed files.

## 5. Future Updates and License Evolution

This license is provisional and subject to updates as Seigr finalizes the full RE License implementation. Future versions of this license may reflect more advanced features, such as IPFS integration, reward structures, and enhanced metadata verification aligned with Seigr’s goals.

**NOTE**: This license text serves as a temporary measure. As we transition to the full RE License, this repository and all contributions therein will adhere to this license's terms until the RE License framework is fully integrated. Contributors are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions for the continued development of this license.

## 6. Disclaimer

This license is provided “as-is,” without warranties or guarantees. Contributors are responsible for understanding the scope and limitations of this provisional license, and Seigr disclaims any liability arising from contributions made under this license.
