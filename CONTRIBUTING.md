## Getting Started

To contribute to Seigr, it‚Äôs beneficial to familiarize yourself with:
- **Decentralized Systems**: Knowledge of distributed networks, consensus protocols, and peer-to-peer architectures.
- **Cryptographic Standards**: Understanding hashing, encryption, and decentralized identity protocols will help when working on Seigr's secure layers.
- **Eco-Inspired Computing**: Seigr‚Äôs architecture follows nature-inspired principles, like self-healing and decentralized intelligence inspired by mycelium networks.

Whether you‚Äôre interested in developing new protocol buffers, optimizing data redundancy, or refining user interfaces, all contributions are welcome!

### Joining the Contributor Team

1. **Review the Issues Board**: Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Seigr-lab/seigr/issues) for areas where contributions are most needed. 
2. **Join Discussions**: Participate in our community discussions, especially if you‚Äôre proposing significant changes. 
3. **Fork the Repository**: Start with a fork of the Seigr repo to work on changes independently.
4. **Introduce Yourself**: Feel free to introduce yourself in the `#contributions` channel on Discord and outline your areas of interest.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **Protocol Buffers Compiler** (`protoc`)
- **Conda** for environment management

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seigr-lab/seigr.git
   cd seigr
   ```

2. **Set up the Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate seigr
   ```

3. **Build Protocol Buffers**:
   - From the project root, build all protocol buffers:
     ```bash
     protoc --proto_path=seigr_protocol --python_out=src/ seigr_protocol/**/*.proto
     ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Ensure your environment is set up correctly by running the initial tests.
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s src/tests
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Areas of Focus

Seigr benefits from contributions in various areas:
- **Protocol Buffers Development**: Expand Seigr‚Äôs modularity by contributing to protocol files in `seigr_protocol/`.
- **Eco-Friendly Encoding**: Explore senary encoding methods for energy-efficient storage and transmission.
- **AI-Driven Analytics**: Implement predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and adaptive scaling.
- **Self-Healing Mechanisms**: Design and improve replication strategies for fault tolerance.
- **Community Documentation**: Help document the technical architecture and eco-inspired computing principles.
- **Security & Identity**: Work on secure identity management, access control, and cryptographic protocols.

### Creating New Protocol Buffers

1. **File Structure**: Place all new protocol buffers in `seigr_protocol/`.
2. **Naming Conventions**: Ensure filenames are descriptive, e.g., `resource_management.proto`, `alerting.proto`.
3. **Documentation**: Include comments for each message, enum, and field.
4. **Compilation**: Run `protoc` to compile new buffers, and check compatibility by running tests.

---

## Coding Standards

### General
- **Modularity**: Organize code in modules that support clean, reusable components.
- **Eco-Alignment**: Use senary encoding when it optimizes resource usage or aligns with Seigr's eco principles.
- **Security**: Ensure cryptographic methods and protocols prioritize data privacy and secure identities.

### Protocol Buffers
- **Field Naming**: Use `snake_case` for all fields, with clear and descriptive names.
- **Enums**: Define enums for states or types rather than using generic integers.
- **Optional Fields**: Use optional fields sparingly to avoid complexity in serialization.
- **Documentation**: Include clear descriptions for each message and enum in `.proto` files.

### Python Code
- **PEP 8**: Follow the PEP 8 style guide.
- **Docstrings**: Add clear, concise docstrings for all functions and classes.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and log them as part of Seigr‚Äôs adaptive learning process.
- **Dependencies**: Keep the number of dependencies minimal; use libraries listed in `environment.yml`.

---

## Documentation Standards

Seigr‚Äôs documentation aligns with its values of transparency and community-driven knowledge sharing. Every contribution should have clear documentation, especially if it introduces new concepts.

### Protocol Documentation

1. **Seigr Protocol Documentation**: All protocol buffers should be documented in `seigr_protocol_documentation.md`.
2. **Detailed Comments**: For each `.proto` file, include purpose-driven comments.
3. **Documenting Complex Messages**: For messages involving advanced structures (e.g., hierarchical or linked messages), provide illustrative examples.

---

## Testing and Validation

Seigr values code quality, especially for contributions impacting network stability or security. Please ensure all contributions include tests.

### Protocol Buffers Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: Test new protocol buffers in `src/tests/test_protos/`.
2. **Mock Data**: Use mock data to test serialization, deserialization, and compatibility.
3. **Integration Tests**: For messages impacting multiple modules, add integration tests.

### Core Testing
1. **Data Validation**: Ensure that data validation routines are tested with boundary cases.
2. **Security**: Test for vulnerabilities in encryption, hashing, and access control functions.

## Continuous Integration and Workflow Checks

Our GitHub repository includes automated workflows to ensure code quality and consistency. The following checks are run automatically on each pull request:

- **Dependency Check**: Verifies that dependencies are secure and up-to-date.
- **IPFS Daemon Check**: Ensures IPFS functionality is active and responsive.
- **Linting**: Ensures code adheres to PEP 8 and project-specific linting standards.
- **Unit Tests**: Runs all project tests to confirm new changes don't introduce errors.
- **Release Automation**: Creates a new release when a semantic version tag is pushed.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your changes pass all checks by running the following commands:

```bash
# Run linting
flake8 src

# Run unit tests
pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings
```

Please ensure your PR passes all checks before requesting a review.
